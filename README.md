my name is Daniel Wang. I have been in Austin since 1998. I have a small computer hardware company with only 3 people. I am always interested to know how the computer software, internet and web world really is. I want to learn how to do the programming if i can afford the time and the efforts. i like to cook. and i like all kind of foods. though i am from Taiwan i love not only Chinese food but foods from all over.
